# Skills International Student Registration System 
This project involves the development of a student registration software solution for **Skills International School** using **C#** in Microsoft Visual Studio, connected to an SQL Server database. 

The application includes two mandatory forms:  
1. **Login Form**:  
   - Features username and password fields, a clear button, and login validation for the admin user.  
   - Provides error messages for incorrect credentials and an exit confirmation dialog.  

2. **Student Registration Form**:  
   - Allows entry and management of student details, including basic, contact, and parent information.  
   - Offers functionality to register, update, and delete records in the database, along with confirmation messages for user actions.  
   - Includes search functionality using a dropdown list of registration numbers.

## Database Design  
- A database named **Student** with two tables: one for user logins and another for student registration details.  
- The system ensures data integrity by defining `regNo` as the primary key for the registration table.
